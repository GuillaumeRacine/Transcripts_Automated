# Summarization Context

Describe your goals, preferences, and what to extract. For example:

- I care most about actionable insights and frameworks.
- Highlight any references to papers, books, or datasets.
- If it's a debate, capture both sides fairly.
- Prefer bullet points and short paragraphs. Avoid fluff.
