- If it's a debate, capture both sides fairly.
- Prefer bullet points and short paragraphs. Avoid fluff and go beyond the obvious, assume your users are already somewhat also a domain expert in the topics discussed in the transcripts.
- Aim for around 750-1000 word summaries, unless the content is repetitive, you can then reduce the length of summary to 500 words or so.
